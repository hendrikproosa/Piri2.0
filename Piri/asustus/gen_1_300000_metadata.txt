Title
Generalized boundaries of Estonian administrative and settlement division, 1 January 2013, scale 1: 300 000

User constraints
The generalized borders of Estonian administrative and settlement division could be used only in thematic mapping in scale 1: 300 000 or close.
The generalized data do not constitute a determination of jurisdictional authority and they are not legal land descriptions.

Data set quality
Codes and names of administrative and settlement units correspond 100% to the classification of Estonian administrative units and settlements version 01.01.2013. The location corresponds to the scale 1: 300 000. The polygons of counties, local government units and settlements are tested for closure: a void does not exist between areas in the same layer; an area must not overlap another area from the same layer; the boundaries of different layer coincide. When settlement or administrative units were not adjacent, a multipart feature was created.
ArcGIS Desktop software package ArcInfo tool “Simplify Polygon” algorithm “Bend Simplify” was used in generalization. The initial data for generalization are the borders of settlement units from 01.01.2012, published by Estonian Land Board.
